<h2>Deep Learning based Recommender System</h2></br>
Traditionally, recommender systems are based on methods such as clustering, nearest neighbor and matrix factorization. However, in recent years, deep learning has yielded tremendous success across multiple domains, from image recognition to natural language processing. Recommender systems have also benefited from deep learning's success. In fact, today's state-of-the-art recommender systems such as those at YouTube and Amazon are powered by complex deep learning systems, and less so on traditional methods. </br>

this model is made from what I learn from Andrew Ng in course 3 in machine learning specialization</br>

<h2>Why this notebook?</h2></br>
While reading through the many useful notebooks here that covers the basics of recommender systems using traditional methods such as matrix factorization, I noticed that there is a lack of tutorials that cover deep learning based recommender systems.
